# Getting and Cleaning Data

This project was created as part of the Getting and Cleaning Data course from Johns Hopkins University via Coursera. The purpose of the project is to input 'real life' data, clean it, and present it in a 'tidy' format. The data is from a study that had participants wear mobile phones and record their movements. The goals of the project are to:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
